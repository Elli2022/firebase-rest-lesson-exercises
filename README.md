# Firebase REST Lesson Exercises

This repository collects several small classroom exercises from a lesson on February 8, 2023 focused on REST, Firebase, and vanilla JavaScript.

## What this project is

This is not one large final project. It is a structured lesson archive where several smaller exercises have been brought together in a single repository. The goal of the merge is to preserve the coursework while making it easier to navigate and understand.

## What it practices

- `fetch` and asynchronous JavaScript
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
- JSONPlaceholder as a test API
- Firebase Realtime Database through REST endpoints
- simple DOM rendering in the browser
- loading, reshaping, and displaying remote data

## Exercises in this repository

### 1. Firebase Products 1

An exercise where product data is requested from Firebase and rendered as simple cards in the browser.

This upgraded version now targets a stronger architecture for portfolio use: Firebase Web SDK, anonymous authentication, and protected Realtime Database reads instead of a fully public endpoint.

### 2. REST CRUD with JSONPlaceholder

An exercise that demonstrates several HTTP methods against a test API:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

### 3. Firebase CRUD

An exercise where data is read, removed, posted back, and replaced in a Firebase database.

### 4. Firebase Products 2

A follow-up exercise where a new product is posted to Firebase and the collection is then requested again.

## Structure

- `index.html`
- `css/style.css`
- `js/script.js`

The project root is a simple landing page and is the page published through GitHub Pages.

- `related-exercises/firebase-produkter-1/`
- `related-exercises/2023-02-08-REST-Firebase/`
- `related-exercises/firebase/`
- `related-exercises/firebase-produkter-2/`

Each subfolder contains a preserved exercise or demo from the same lesson.

## Firebase

This repo is linked to the Firebase project **`firebase-rest-lesson-exercises`** (Realtime Database in `us-central1`). Setup, paths, and seed commands are documented in [FIREBASE.md](./FIREBASE.md).

## GitHub Pages

The repository is published at:

- `https://elli2022.github.io/firebase-rest-lesson-exercises/`

## Context

- This is preserved coursework, not a production application.
- The code reflects learning and experimentation rather than a polished final delivery.
- Some files are intentionally simple because they come from an early classroom context.
